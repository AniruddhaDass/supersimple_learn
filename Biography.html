 A big fat book about a dead person, you might reply. A book with lots of dates and some pictures and chapters going chronologically from cradle to grave. A book about a single person’s life and work, but probably with a great deal, too, about their family and friends, relations and children, colleagues and acquaintances.

The word ‘biography’ means ‘life-writing’: the two halves of the word derive from medieval Greek bios, ‘life’, and graphia, ‘writing’. Dictionary definitions give you “the history of the lives of individual men, as a branch of literature”, or “a written record of the life of an individual” (Oxford English Dictionary, 1971), or, more up-to-date and succinct, “An account of someone’s life written by someone else” (New Oxford Dictionary of English, 2001). Essentially, it’s the written story of another person’s life.

The word started to be used, in western literature, in the late 18th century, but biography reaches far back through histories and cultures to all kinds of older forms: the ancient Sumerian epic of Gilgamesh, full of conflict and adventure; classical and Egyptian lives of rulers and illustrious heroes, with warning stories of triumphs turning to disaster and decline; venerating biographies of Tibetan Buddhist leaders or medieval Christian saints, showing you how best to live under the eye of God. Mainly, biography used to be the Lives of Great Men (and less often, women), written to give you something to live up to or learn from. But it’s become a more democratic form of writing. ‘Lives’ can be written of ‘ordinary’ people as well as kings and saints.

And there have come to be many different kinds of biographical narratives. It doesn’t have to be the written story of a dead person. Biography can take the form of a film or a poem, an obituary or an opera. It can be about a living subject, or a group, or a city, or a river, or an animal. You can start at the end, with a death-bed, or tell the story of one year in a life. Biography often goes back to a famous life-story that’s been told before – think of Van Gogh, Nelson Mandela, Keats, Sylvia Plath, or Mahatma Gandhi – so it can be a form of revision. Virginia Woolf said: “There are some stories which have to be retold by each generation”. </p>

Biography is the earliest literary genre in history. According to Egyptologist Miriam Lichtheim, writing took its first steps toward literature in the context of the private tomb funerary inscriptions. These were commemorative biographical texts recounting the careers of deceased high royal officials.[2] The earliest biographical texts are from the 26th century BC.

In the 21st century BC, another famous biography was composed in Mesopotamia about Gilgamesh. One of the five versions could be historical.

From the same region a couple of centuries later, according to another famous biography, departed Abraham. He and his 3 descendants became subjects of ancient Hebrew biographies whether fictional or historical.

</table>was Cornelius Nepos, who published his work Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae ("Lives of outstanding generals") in 44 BC. Longer and more extensive biographies were written in Greek by Plutarch, in his Parallel Lives, published about 80 A.D. In this work famous Greeks are paired with famous Romans, for example, the orators Demosthenes and Cicero, or the generals Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar; some fifty biographies from the work survive. Another well-known collection of ancient biographies is De vita Caesarum ("On the Lives of the Caesars") by Suetonius, written about AD 121 in the time of the emperor Hadrian. Meanwhile, in the eastern imperial periphery, Gospel described the life of Jesus.

In the early Middle Ages (AD 400 to 1450), there was a decline in awareness of the classical culture in Europe. During this time, the only repositories of knowledge and records of the early history in Europe were those of the Roman Catholic Church. Hermits, monks, and priests used this historic period to write biographies. Their subjects were usually restricted to the church fathers, martyrs, popes, and saints. Their works were meant to be inspirational to the people and vehicles for conversion to Christianity (see Hagiography). One significant secular example of a biography from this period is the life of Charlemagne by his courtier Einhard.

In Medieval Western India, there was a Sanskrit Jain literary genre of writing semi-historical biographical narratives about the lives of famous persons called Prabandhas. Prabandhas were written primarily by Jain scholars from the 13th century onwards and were written in colloquial Sanskrit (as opposed to Classical Sanskrit).[3] The earliest collection explicitly titled Prabandha- is Jinabhadra's Prabandhavali (1234 CE).

In Medieval Islamic Civilization (c. AD 750 to 1258), similar traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad and other important figures in the early history of Islam began to be written, beginning the Prophetic biography tradition. Early biographical dictionaries were published as compendia of famous Islamic personalities from the 9th century onwards. They contained more social data for a large segment of the population than other works of that period. The earliest biographical dictionaries initially focused on the lives of the prophets of Islam and their companions, with one of these early examples being The Book of The Major Classes by Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi. And then began the documentation of the lives of many other historical figures (from rulers to scholars) who lived in the medieval Islamic world.[4] </p>
