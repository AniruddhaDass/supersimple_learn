Tree plantation refers to planting more trees across the country. A happy and peaceful life is not possible without trees. Some people are recklessly cutting down trees everywhere. They do not think that the destruction of trees destroys the ecosystem. As a result, our country is going to become a whole desert. In this we may face problems like flood, land erosion, lack of rain etc. It poses a great threat to our ecosystem. Trees play a significant role in our day to day life. We need oxygen to survive. Trees give us this oxygen. They give us food and fruits. They also shelter us. From trees we get wood and without wood we cannot make household furniture, boats, launches, ships etc. If trees are planted along the banks of rivers and seas, erosion can be prevented. It also prevents air pollution. Trees protect the country from harmful greenhouse effect. The higher lands of the river valleys are suitable for growth and development of afforestation. Beaches, lowlands and wastelands can be brought under afforestation with specific types of trees suitable for the soil. June-July is the best time for planting. We should plant more trees to save the environment. Plantation programs should be extended to remote areas of the country. Officials concerned with this program should take proper steps and necessary measures to make it successful. Government should take necessary steps to encourage people to plant trees. The necessity and importance of trees can never be ignored. So it is our duty to plant more trees and take care of them for our own well-being and existence.The life of every animal on earth including humans is directly or indirectly related to trees. Trees have made this land habitable, providing essential food for animals and above all maintaining the earth’s ecological and climatic balance. And so there is no alternative to planting trees to preserve the natural balance. It is desirable for any country to have at least 25 percent forest cover on its mainland. But compared to that, the amount of forest land in Bangladesh is only 16 percent of the total area. Even in such a situation, we are often killing trees indiscriminately from all around for no reason. In this we are moving towards an inevitable end. The environment of Bangladesh has become a victim of pollution today. As a result, there is excessive rain or no rain. Every year Bangladesh is devastated by flash floods, landslides and cyclones. The climate of this country is gradually moving towards extremes. Maybe in the future Bangladesh will turn into a desert. And in the absence of trees, it is not possible to stop the greenhouse effect. Ozone layer depletion and global warming may lead to submergence of Bangladesh’s coastal areas if sea level rises. Plantation or development of tree resources is therefore linked to our existence. For effective implementation of the goals and objectives of forest expansion and forest conservation, public and private efforts are required. However, some of the duties to be performed in this regard are – prevention of free and arbitrary clearing of forests, planting of new saplings and their necessary maintenance, enforcement of laws to prevent the cutting of immature trees, establishment of social forestry in new areas, organization of tree fairs, etc. Only if the tree plantation campaign can be carried out with the concerted efforts of all these, our land including Bangladesh will become habitable again.<a href="file:///C:/Users/KANA%20DAS/Desktop/html.html"target="_blank"> Click Here for some picture </a>

The earth is burning. And we are the reason behind it. An unprecedented rise in the global atmospheric temperature on earth can be termed as global warming.The average temperature on earth has increased by 1.5 degrees Celsius since the last decade. Global warming is not a single phenomenon; rather, a series of interlinked events that fuel the ultimate rise in global temperatures. It has a plethora of effects across different levels of the ecosystem. In some parts of the world, the effect is negligible, while in others, the effect is significant. Burning of fossil fuel and respiration by animals releases gases like carbon dioxide that escapes into the atmosphere.The heat rays reflecting from the surface of the earth get trapped in the atmosphere because of the carbon dioxide present in it. This is known as the <a href="https://climatekids.nasa.gov/greenhouse-effect/#:~:text=The%20greenhouse%20effect%20is%20a,a%20comfortable%20place%20to%20live." target="_blank">greenhouse effect.</a> It is necessary to prevent our planet from becoming a frozen ball. But excessive carbon dioxide retains all the heat emanating from the earth’s surface, leading to global warming. The main gases responsible for global warming are known as greenhouse gases.The chief greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. These gases, when present in unbalanced amounts, result in global warming. Global warming can wipe out the entire human population from the surface of the earth and therefore, must be curbed at the earliest. While the damage cannot be reversed, we can ensure that the effects are controlled to some extent. The first thing we need to do is lead a mass afforestation drive. Next, we can shift from conventional sources of energy like petroleum to cleaner ones like solar and wind energy.Global warming is the all over rise in temperature of the earth surface. It has affected the environment and whole atmosphere and has resulted into the huge level climate change. A huge change in the earth’s climate system because of the global warming is observed in the recent past years. The effects of increased global temperature are melting ice, warmed continents, increasing sea level, seasonal changes, climate changes, changing precipitation, expansion of deserts in the subtropics regions, etc. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported in 2014 that according to scientists, global warming is mostly a human being created environmental issue. It is mainly caused by ever increasing level of greenhouse gases on the earth.Impacts of global warming differ from region to region all over the world. Retreat of glaciers, sea ice, more frequent extreme weather events, heat waves, heavy rainfall and snowfall, droughts, floods, ocean acidification, species extinctions, etc are some huge impacts of shifting temperature regimes. In order to reduce the effect of global warming, effective societal responses are needed to be implemented and followed urgently.Carbon dioxide is one of the main green house gases, the increased amount of which is causing a warming effect on the earth surface which in turn causes evaporation of more water and creates water vapor (a type of greenhouse gas). In this way, the level of green house gases in the atmosphere are increasing and creating more warming effect. CO2 level is also increasing because of the burning fossil fuels. Other green house gases like Sulphur, CFCs, Methane, etc are also responsible for increasing global warming. The level of these gases is increasing due to the population growth, urbanization, industrialization, technological advancement, and deforestation.It has been a serious issue and putting our future at risk as well as existence of life on the earth. It is considered that deforestation and rise in carbon dioxide level is primary issue of increasing global warming. Emitting greenhouse gases from vehicles and CFC gas from air-conditioners are very dangerous as they are empowering this demon. Such gases especially CFC erode the ozone layer and make holes which pass ultraviolet rays and affect living beings on the earth. Increasing sea level creates the fear of submerging coastal regions and completely finishing few islands in near future thus making people homeless. Overpopulation causes overuse of natural resources and technologies which is not good for welfare of human beings.<a href="file:///C:/Users/KANA%20DAS/Desktop/global%20warmng.html"target="_blank">Click Here for some picture </a>

Environment pollution refers to the destruction of the basic elements of the environment such as soil, water, air and the normal structure of the organism. In other words, if the environment becomes uninhabitable for animals, it is called environment pollution. The environment is being polluted due to human negligence and lavishness. Environment pollution is mainly due to two reasons. One is the natural causes, such as storms, floods, tidal waves, volcanoes, earthquakes, etc. The second is man-made which is artificial, such as water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution, radioactive pollution, etc. Industrial wastes, toxic fumes from vehicles, etc are mixing in the air and polluting the environment. As a result of various fossil fuels, the amount of carbon dioxide in the air is increasing. The water of rivers, seas, ponds and canals of the world is getting polluted every day. Industrial wastes, chemicals used in crop lands etc. are poisoning the water. Soil pollution is increasing due to unplanned urbanization, frequent dumping of garbage, use of toxic chemicals in land etc. In addition, loud car horns, indiscriminate use of mics, loud noises of factory equipment, etc. are the main causes of noise pollution. All in all, environmental pollution is now widespread. According to Bangladesh, the level of pollution in third world countries is even more alarming. The world’s climate is changing as a result of environmental pollution. The global temperature is constantly rising due to the greenhouse effect. The prevalence of various types of incurable diseases is increasing. Today, the environment of the whole world is under threat due to pollution. Our awareness is the key to protecting the environment. Reduce the use of fossil fuels and find renewable energy sources to ensure its proper use. The environment should be filled with greenery by planting lots of plants. Besides, public awareness activities should be conducted to prevent environmental pollution.In primitive times, people were totally dependent on the environment. But with the growing civilization, people began to subjugate nature. Various discoveries of science and technology have given people happiness and comfort. But the misuse of the technology discovered is polluting the environment day by day. Environment is a collection of natural and unnatural elements around us. Water, soil, air etc. are important elements of natural environment. If the desired quality of the elements of the environment is destroyed due to natural or man-made causes, then the environment becomes unhealthy for humans or animals. This unhealthy condition of the environment is called environmental pollution. The natural causes of environmental pollution are storms, floods, tides, eruptions, earthquakes, etc. And the artificial or man-made factors are – population growth, toxic chemicals in industries.Consumption, use of fossil fuels in industries and vehicles etc. Due to these reasons, the important elements of the environment such as water, soil, air, etc. are constantly being polluted. Besides, the environment is also polluted due to the use of pesticides, powdered soap, plastic, etc. Sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, CFC etc. emitted from industries and vehicles are damaging the atmosphere. The conscious people of the world are worried about the dire consequences of environmental pollution. Because the existence of human civilization is threatened due to environmental pollution. Therefore, conscious people of the world have woken up to protect the environment; Many environmental organizations are developing. In the united efforts of these organizations, the international community gathers in various environmental conferences to decide what to do to prevent environmental pollution. Like many other countries, the constitution of Bangladesh has also included clauses related to environmental protection. But it is not possible to prevent environmental pollution without making people at all levels aware about the environment.

Food adulteration means adding or mixing another substance to a food item in order to make more profit, preserve it for a long time or make it appealing. It reduces the actual quality of food item and causes health hazards. It is considered to be one of the major problems in our country. There is hardly any food that is not adulterated in one way or another.There are many bad impacts of adulterated food. They are generally harmful to health and cause serious health problems like digest problem, diarrhea, dysentery, cancer, kidney failure, heart problem etc. The adulterated foods are nothing but slow poison that’s kills people slowly. Nowadays adulteration of food in our country is so widespread that it is difficult to find a food item which is safe to eat.Milk and milk products are poorly processed, vegetables have pesticides with item, fishes are preserved with formalin and fruits are preserved with poisonous chemicals. A recent survey conducted in some areas of Dhaka city reports that 40% of 82% samples of, milk products, fish, fruits and vegetables contained DDT, Aldrin and other poisonous chemicals.
It is not unknown that strict monitoring and supervision in the production process can control food adulteration to a great extent. It is not possible for Govt. alone to control the widespread adulteration of foods. General public should be aware and should boycott the product that is detected to be adulterated. Also, Govt. must enact strict laws against adulteration. Capital punishment should be ensured to the dishonest traders who are involved in food adulteration.Food is one of the basic needs of human life. By taking foods we get heat and energy. It helps to survive on the earth. But our food is being adulterated. Food adulteration means the process of making food by mixing another substance or chemical which makes the food less pure and harmful for the human body. Chemicals are mixed with food to make the food attractive. Food loses its purity and standard in this way. By taking these foods, we become ill. It destroys the disease preventive power of the human body.Food is called human fuel. This is one of the fundamental needs of human life. To grow up and survive on the earth, every human being needs food. But, unfortunately, some dishonest businessmen are responsible to make this life-leading food into an adulterated product. Food adulteration has become nowadays a national issue. When a substance is added to any food item to increase its quantity, not quality is called food adulteration. Any kind of food item including fruits, vegetables, oil, fish, milk products, fast foods, and baby foods is being contaminated with poisonous chemicals.The main reasons behind this food adulteration are high profit and to remain a fresh good look for a longer period. Some greedy, immoral and dishonest businessmen are behind the behind-scene in this social crime. Contaminated foods contain destructive substances such as Aldrin, DDT, formalin, Chlordane, etc. Several kinds of research there are hardly any food products from vegetables to milk, meat to fish, juice, or biscuit that are not adulterated.Even the hotels and restaurants serve food menus that are harmful to human health. As adulterants decrease the quality of food, consuming this type of food weakens one’s health. As a result, the cost of healthcare increases. From curable to incurable, various serious disorders and diseases such as liver damage, kidney failure, cancer, heart diseases, headache, high blood pressure, dysentery, diarrhea, etc are caused by taking adulterated foods regularly. This issue has become now a great concern for both the public and the government. It is the right time to take action to eradicate this serious crime. To find out and punish dishonest businessmen, mobile courts have been set up by the government. But this is not enough.To monitor the food producing and manufacturing, retail, and wholesale sale sections a special monitoring cell should be formed. The government, common people, mass media, and law enforcement agencies have to work together in a concerted effort to remove this issue. Food adulteration is a curse to our society. This increases the load on health. Its consequences are so pathetic that many common people are the poor victim of this crime. To save the people and to give a safe place to live to the next generation, food adulteration must be removed from society.
